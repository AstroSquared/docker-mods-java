The following versions are available:
* Java 8: add `astrosquared/docker-mods-java:code-server-java8` to your mods
* Java 11: use the [upstream version](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/code-server-java11)
* Java 17: add `astrosquared/docker-mods-java:code-server-java17` to your mods

The source code is available on the branch `code-server-javaX` where `X` is the Java version number.

Also note that these were only tested on code-server, but should work on openvscode-server.
